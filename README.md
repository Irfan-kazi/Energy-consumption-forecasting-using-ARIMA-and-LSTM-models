Energy-Consumption-Analysis-Using-RNN, LSTM, and ARCA Model
A single household's electricity consumption over a four-year period is described in the multivariate time series dataset known as the Household Power Consumption dataset. They were put to the test to forecast for a particular home and neighborhood over a predetermined amount of time. Over the last few decades, there has been a significant growth in energy demand. The electrical distributors are greatly burdened by this rise. Therefore, the dealer would have an advantage if they could predict future electricity demand. Energy consumption prediction involves multiple parameters. In order to estimate potential power use, this study presents two techniques: one that uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the other that uses a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. Both methods rely solely on past electricity consumption data.
